# Production Testing Plan - Multi-Tenant System

## 🚀 Deployment Status
✅ **Successfully pushed to GitHub**: 34 files changed, 4769 insertions  
✅ **Commit Hash**: 37e2dfd8  
✅ **Auto-deployment**: Should trigger on your production server  

## 🧪 Production Testing Checklist

### 1. **Marketing Site Testing**
Test the main marketing site functionality:

**URL to test**: `https://ghostautocrm.com`
- [ ] ✅ Marketing page loads correctly
- [ ] ✅ Login page is accessible at `/login`
- [ ] ✅ Features page at `/features` 
- [ ] ✅ Pricing page at `/pricing`
- [ ] ✅ No subdomain detected (should route to marketing)

**Expected behavior**: Should show your main marketing site with the enhanced login form.

### 2. **Tenant Subdomain Testing**

Since you don't have wildcard DNS set up yet, you'll need to configure DNS for each tenant subdomain:

**Test URLs** (once DNS is configured):
- `https://demo.ghostautocrm.com/tenant-test`
- `https://acme-auto.ghostautocrm.com/tenant-test`  
- `https://premium-cars.ghostautocrm.com/tenant-test`

**Expected behavior**: Each should show tenant-specific branding and features.

### 3. **Middleware Logging**
Check your production logs for middleware debugging output:
```
🔍 Middleware: ghostautocrm.com | Subdomain: null | Path: / | Marketing: true | Tenant: false
🔍 Middleware: demo.ghostautocrm.com | Subdomain: demo | Path: /tenant-test | Marketing: false | Tenant: true
```

### 4. **API Endpoint Testing**
Test the tenant API endpoint:
- `https://ghostautocrm.com/api/tenant/current` → Should return error (no tenant)
- `https://demo.ghostautocrm.com/api/tenant/current` → Should return demo tenant data

## 🔧 DNS Configuration Needed

### Option A: Wildcard DNS (Recommended)
Add a wildcard DNS record to your domain:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *.ghostautocrm.com  
Value: ghostautocrm.com
```

### Option B: Individual Subdomains
Add individual DNS records:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: demo
Value: ghostautocrm.com

Type: CNAME  
Name: acme-auto
Value: ghostautocrm.com

Type: CNAME
Name: premium-cars
Value: ghostautocrm.com
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "getSubdomain is not defined" 
**Solution**: The middleware should auto-restart. Check server logs.

### Issue 2: Tenant not found errors
**Solution**: The system uses fallback sample data, so this shouldn't happen.

### Issue 3: Marketing site redirects incorrectly
**Check**: Ensure your production URL matches `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable.

### Issue 4: Subdomain routing not working
**Check**: 
1. DNS configuration is correct
2. Middleware logs show correct subdomain detection
3. Next.js config supports dynamic routing

## 📊 Testing Commands

### Test Marketing Site
```bash
curl -H "Host: ghostautocrm.com" https://ghostautocrm.com/
curl -H "Host: ghostautocrm.com" https://ghostautocrm.com/api/tenant/current
```

### Test Tenant Sites (after DNS setup)
```bash
curl -H "Host: demo.ghostautocrm.com" https://demo.ghostautocrm.com/api/tenant/current
curl -H "Host: acme-auto.ghostautocrm.com" https://acme-auto.ghostautocrm.com/api/tenant/current
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Marketing site works** - Main site loads without errors  
✅ **Enhanced login page** - New Zod-validated login form works  
✅ **Middleware logs** - Subdomain detection logging appears  
✅ **API fallback data** - Tenant API returns sample data  
✅ **No breaking changes** - Existing functionality still works  

## 🔄 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Set up wildcard DNS** for full subdomain support
2. **Configure database** with the tenant migration  
3. **Add custom domains** for enterprise tenants
4. **Build tenant admin panel** for managing tenants
5. **Integrate billing** for subscription management

## 📞 Quick Test URLs

Once deployed, test these URLs immediately:
- ✅ `https://ghostautocrm.com` (marketing site)
- ✅ `https://ghostautocrm.com/login` (enhanced login) 
- ✅ `https://ghostautocrm.com/tenant-test` (should show "Marketing Site Detected")
- ⏳ `https://demo.ghostautocrm.com/tenant-test` (requires DNS setup)

**The system is designed to be production-safe with fallback data, so nothing should break existing functionality!**
